## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- CSS Custom Properties

### What I learned

After implementing this solution, I now  effectively understand "rem" units and how to effectively implement them. 


### Continued development

I often harp on the question of am I developing my CSS using best practices. Because I find myself putting these CSS solutions together in a guess and check style, I feel like I am sort of hacking the solution together and not using CSS in the way it is supposed to be structured and written. I do not think my CSS code is very easy to read or follow and is just sort of random in the way of getting it to work.
